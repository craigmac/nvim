TODO {{{1

- TSInstall is hanging/not working on Windows? install treesitter-cli
- try lua vim.treesitter.start() on all FileType
- FZFLua colors not right under gui, is there a setting for it?
- install that plugin from reddit that shows state of linked issues in the
  buffer via virtualtext so we don't need to track them ourselves

BACKLOG {{{1

- let's map s/S/C-s to gh,gH,g_CTRL-H (char/line/block Select mode)?
- add indenting current visual selecting on [e and ]e as well
- add yo<key> toggles that I use for boolean options
- investigate how vim-unimpaired does >p and =p 
- implemented lastchange update on save of .vim/VIMRUNTIME files:
  `:map <F2> msHmtgg/Last [cC]hange:\s*/e+1<CR>"_D"=strftime("%Y %b %d")<CR>p'tzt`s
- `[Process exited 0]` on TermClose, just close it!
- fix commands.lua TitleCaseLine etc. working on Vim but not here
- set when in nvim: `vim.o.completefuzzycollect = 'keyword,files,whole_line'`
- setup `:h fuzzy-file-picker` in case fzf-lua unavailable
- fix: '$' signcolumn characters that mark OSC133 prompt start in pwsh are off
  by one line after first prompt
- term: mark output areas and add [v and ]v to visual select last/next output, base on
  OSC 133 work done in `$VIMRUNTIME/lua/vim/_defaults.lua:591`. maybe upstream
  it.
