BACKLOG {{{1

- oil.nvim? much easier than netrw
- toggle term bindings
- setup `:h fuzzy-file-picker` in case fzf-lua unavailable
- fix: '$' signcolumn characters that mark OSC133 prompt start in pwsh are off
  by one line after first prompt
- term: mark output areas and add [v and ]v to visual select last/next output, base on
  OSC 133 work done in `$VIMRUNTIME/lua/vim/_defaults.lua:591`. maybe upstream
